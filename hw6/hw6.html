Homework 6
    1. What is HTTP? What are the different HTTP request methods and how do they differ?
        HTTP, or the Hypertext Transport Protocol, is used to transmit hypermedia documents, like HTML, between web browsers
        and web servers. A request is made to a server from the browser, which then waits until it receives a response from
        the server. Web servers do not keepy any data between two requests, making HTTP a stateless protocol. HTTP methods
        include “get” which sends a request to the server, “post” which saves data from the website in the server, “put” which
        replaces code on the website with code from the server, “patch” which edits code, and “delete” which deletes code. 

    2. What is an API? What is JSON?
        APIs, or Application Programming Interface, enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of
        definitions and protocols. APIs are usually between web browsers and web servers. Today, most APIS are shared through
        JSON, or Javascript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON allows for the
        transfer of text data across a network, allows for the storing of various datatypes as human readable code through
        arrays and objects. It is perfect for storing temporary data. JSON is used when data is sent form a server to a website,
        and is easy to understand. JSON can be integrated into Javascript easier, through the use of built-in functions. JSON
        exists as a string in Javascript, and can be parsed using those built-in functions. 

    3. What is AJAX? What is meant by asynchronous code?
        AJAX, or Asynchronous Javascript and XML, is a browser built-in XMLHTTPRequest object, and uses Javascript and HTML DOM.
        The XMLHTTPRequest requests data from a server, and Javascript and HTML display and use the data. AJAX enables a website
        to update without reloading, send data to a server in the background, and read data from a web server after a page is
        loaded. Asynchronous programming allows Javascript code to run in the background without blocking the execution of other 
        code. 

    4. Use jquery to make some requests to our json server:
        a. Write a get request to request the data from one of the resources.
        b. Write a post request to add a new resource.
        c. Write a put request to replace a previous resource.
