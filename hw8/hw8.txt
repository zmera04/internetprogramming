1. What does it mean to escape data? How does escaping data help us avoid malicious code?
    Escaping data removes special meanings to certain key characters in an input, received from a website, in the hopes
    to prevent that data from being interpreted as executable code. Escaping data would help remove malicious code by
    changing something like "<script>" which is executable, into "&lt;script&gt;" which is not executable. 

2a. What is REST? What is meant by Statelessness?
        REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, provides standards for computer systems to communicate with eachother. 
        RESTful systems are stateless and implementations of the client and server are independent of each other. 
        separate the concerns of the client and server. Statelessness means that the server does not need to know
        anything about the what state the client is in, and the client not needing to know what state the server is in.

2b. What is a resource?
    Resources describe any object, document, or thing that one needs to store and/or send to other places. 

2c. Look at the section on Path design: In a RESTful architecture paradigm what
would be the proper way to create a path for: (provide URL and HTTP method):
i. getting a list of users?
    GET localhost:8888/users

ii. getting a particular user?
    GET localhost:8888/users/:id

iii. saving a user?
    POST localhost:8888/users

3. What is a Cookie?
    Cookies are little pieces of data saved to the browser. Cookies are sent to the browser by the server, which gives the browser permission to the browser to
    request more data, using that same cookie. Cookies are on the front-end. 
4. What is a Session?
    Sessions store information about a user, which is gathered durign a single site visit. Sessions are on the back-end.
