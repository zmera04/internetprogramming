Homework 3
    Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.

    When using HTML and CSS, every element follows a box model. In this model, the content of an element is wrapped in a padding,
border, and margin. Padding refers to the space between the content and border of an element. Border refers to the border
between the padding and the margin. Margin refers to the area outside the border.
    Both the padding and margin are transparent, and clear a designated space. Adjustments to either attribute results in more 
clear space between the content of an element and that of another. However, designer can make the border of an element
visible, and any color.
